You can also use the [online editor](/editor) to write your Casbin model and policy in your web browser. It provides functionality such as "syntax highlighting" and "code completion", just like an IDE for a programming language.

## Usage Pattern

If you are using "RBAC with pattern" or "RBAC with all pattern", the pattern matching function is specified in the lower left corner.

![editor-tips](/img/editor-tips.png).

If you want to write the equivalent code, you need to specify the pattern matching function through the relevant API. Refer to [RBAC with Pattern](/docs/rbac-with-pattern) for more information.

:::note

The editor is based on [node-casbin](https://github.com/casbin/node-casbin). Due to the synchronization delay between different versions of Casbin, the authentication result of the "editor" may differ from the authentication result of the Casbin version you are using. If you encounter any issues, please submit them to the Casbin repository you are using.
